                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <h3>The Key Ingredient</h3>
                <p>
                    As Singaporeans, food has always been our chief passion and our nation's past-time. And passion, indeed, is what drives us at Lee Wee & Brothers' to continue plating iconic mouth-watering local delights for our valued customers.
                    <br><br>We (Lee Wee, Ben, Mark and Angeline) grew up surrounded by food. Our big family gathers once a week for a feast, a spread consisting of scrumptious and heart-warming local food fare. We would invite you there, surely, but with so many family members already present (and growing), there’s hardly any room for guests!
                    <br>So, we devised a plan to share our delectable family flavours with the masses.
                </p>
                <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
                <p>
                    We set up our first stall along Old Airport Road, and at that stall, our mother imparted the family heritage recipes to us.<br>
                    Our youngest brother Mark invented our iconic giant aluminium Otah signboard which was first displayed at Old Airport Road outlet. It was handcrafted together with second brother Ben, something which had left a fond impression on our customers up till today.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Recipes</h3>
                <p>
                    Ben and Mark gained culinary tutelage from our mother to master the traditional techniques of “rempah-making”, “pangang”, as well as her iconic recipes so as to share our local delights such as Otah, Nasi Lemak and Curry Chicken with our customers.

                    For our kitchens to be operating efficiently, we have committed to equipping all our staff with the critical knowledge of food safety and hygiene. Our kitchen and delivery vehicles are sanitised and undergo stringent daily audits by our Quality Assurance team. Additionally, all our staff are required to be in proper food preparation gear: hair nets, face masks and gloves while preparing food and are certified in Basic Food Hygiene. We also set-in place ISO 9000 and ISO 22000 accredited food safety and quality management systems to close up potential lapses in our food preparation. This way, with our safety protocols and frameworks, we can ensure our customers will stay healthy and happy when enjoying our food.
